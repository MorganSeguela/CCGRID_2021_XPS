SETUP
##################

To run this image, you have to choose which experiment you want to run with argument WHICH_XP. Then run the container. 

This will run a java jar, and then writes all the outputs in experience/output/

##################
MODIFICATION
##################

You can change all the values in the input parameters file.
However, the number of file is limited to 67 200, due to automatic filename generation in the application. 
Also, this should be noted that, the number of VM is unlimited, but, the network matrixes is very large. So the more VMs there is, the more memory is needed.
